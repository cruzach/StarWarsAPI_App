# Star Wars Application

This project's main purpose was to get comfortable with making calls to an API, which would respond with JSON data. Additionally, it helped with gaining some more experience with create-react-app and React in general. Another huge bonus was more exposure to NPM, which is also where I found that awesome background effect!
